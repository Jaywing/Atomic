<h1 class="Article-title">Javascript</h1>
<p class="Text--lead">Modular ES6 (with async loading) with Babel and Webpack!</p>
<p>In development, JavaScript is compiled with <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware">webpack-dev-middleware</a> and <a href="https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware">webpack-hot-middleware</a> by <a href="/Jaywing/atomic/blob/develop/src/javascripts/gulpfile.js/tasks/browserSync.js#L14-L19">passing these into BrowserSync</a> as <a href="https://browsersync.io/docs/options/#option-middleware">middleware</a>. This means that the javascript is compiled and injected into the page by webpack, actual javascript files are not generated until production is run.  You don't have to take advantage of <a href="https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack">webpack hot module replacement</a>, but it's there if you want it! But before you go and do that, read <a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/hot-reloading-in-react-1140438583bf#.jhcp6x3rl">Dan Abramov's disclaimer</a>, which is also a great tutorial on using vanilla Webpack HMR.</p>

<p>There are a couple of webpack options exposed in the top-level <code>gulpfile.js/config.json</code> file.</p>

<h3><code>entries</code></h3>
<p>Discrete js bundle entry points. A js file will be bundled for each item. Paths are relative to the javascripts folder. This maps directly to <code>webpackConfig.entry</code>.</p>

<h3><code>extractSharedJs</code></h3>
<p>Creates a <code>shared.js</code> file that contains any modules shared by multiple bundles (don't forget to include that on the page!). Useful on large sites with discrete js running on different pages that may share common modules or libraries. For smaller sites, you'll probably want to skip the async stuff, and just compile a single bundle by setting extractSharedJs to false.</p>

<h3>Advanced</h3>
<p>If you want to mess with the specifics of the webpack config, check out <code>gulpfile.js/lib/webpack-multi-config.js</code>.</p>
